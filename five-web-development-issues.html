				<h2>Users and usability</h2>
				<p>When designing a website, it’s important to keep in mind who is going to be using your site and what they are going to be using it for. Users should be able to use your site to accomplish tasks quickly and with minimal effort. The most frequently accessed information and resources should be available to the user with minimal scrolling or navigating. Grouping related content can also help usability.</p>
				
				<h2>Cross‐browser compatibility</h2>
				<p>It’s important to make your website compatible with most browsers. Users need to be able to access your site with their web browser; as there are many different browsers, it’s best to test your site with at least the most commonly used browsers. Using features standardized by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> will ensure that your site will work with almost all web browsers; as most browsers will typically adhere to those standards. When using newer features, you should provide a fallback for older browsers that don’t yet support those new features.</p>
				
				<h2>User accessibility</h2>
				<p>Your website should be accessible by all users, including those that are disabled or impaired. It’s important to make sure your site can still be used without visuals, audio, or the use of a pointing device such as a mouse.</p>
				
				<h2>Search engine optimiztion</h2>
				<p>Making your site visible to search engines is important for users to be able to find your site. Using semantic elements in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> will help users find your site when searching for relevant information.</p>
				
				<h2>Responsive web design</h2>
				<p>A website should be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes. Using scalable images, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> media queries, and flexible layouts are key to making a site responsive.</p>
